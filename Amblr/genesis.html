<br><br><i>1:</i>  In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.        <br>   <i>2:</i>  And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness  was upon the  face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the  waters.        <br>   <i>3:</i>  And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.        <br>   <i>4:</i>  And God saw the light, that it was good: and God  divided the light  from the darkness.        <br>   <i>5:</i>  And God called the light Day, and the darkness he  called Night. And  the evening and the morning were the first day.        <br>   <i>6:</i>  And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of  the waters, and  let it divide the waters from the waters.        <br>   <i>7:</i>  And God made the firmament, and divided the waters  which were  under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament:  and  it was so.        <br>   <i>8:</i>  And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening  and the  morning were the second day.        <br>   <i>9:</i>  And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be  gathered together  unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.        <br>   <i>10:</i>  And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering  together of the  waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.        <br>   <i>11:</i>  And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the  herb yielding seed,  and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in  itself, upon  the earth: and it was so.        <br>   <i>12:</i>  And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding  seed after his  kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after  his kind: and  God saw that it was good.        <br>   <i>13:</i>  And the evening and the morning were the third day.        <br>   <i>14:</i>  And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of  the heaven to  divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for  seasons, and  for days, and years:        <br>   <i>15:</i>  And let them be for lights in the firmament of the  heaven to give light  upon the earth: and it was so.        <br>   <i>16:</i>  And God made two great lights; the greater light to  rule the day, and  the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.        <br>   <i>17:</i>  And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to  give light upon  the earth,        <br>   <i>18:</i>  And to rule over the day and over the night, and to  divide the light  from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.        <br>   <i>19:</i>  And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.        <br>   <i>20:</i>  And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly  the moving  creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in  the open  firmament of heaven.        <br>   <i>21:</i>  And God created great whales, and every living  creature that moveth,  which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and  every  winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.        <br>   <i>22:</i>  And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and  multiply, and fill the  waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.        <br>   <i>23:</i>  And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.        <br>   <i>24:</i>  And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living  creature after his  kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his  kind: and it  was so.        <br>   <i>25:</i>  And God made the beast of the earth after his kind,  and cattle after  their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his  kind: and  God saw that it was good.        <br>   <i>26:</i>  And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our  likeness: and  let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl  of the air,  and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every  creeping thing that  creepeth upon the earth.        <br>   <i>27:</i>  So God created man in his own image, in the image of  God created he  him; male and female created he them.        <br>   <i>28:</i>  And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be  fruitful, and  multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion  over the  fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every  living thing that  moveth upon the earth.        <br>   <i>29:</i>  And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb  bearing seed,  which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the  which is the  fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.        <br>   <i>30:</i>  And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of  the air, and to  every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I  have given  every green herb for meat: and it was so.        <br>   <i>31:</i>  And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold,  it was very  good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.          <br>    </p>   <script src="http://www.lib.virginia.edu/libtools.js" type="text/javascript"></script></BODY>
