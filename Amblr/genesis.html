<p style="font-size:36px">The history of the Gothic revival can be nowhere better traced<BR>
than in the University and College buildings at Oxford. The last    <BR>
Italian building (if it can be called Italian) was the Taylor Build-<BR>
ing in 1842. Before that there had been many attempts at Gothic,    <BR>
the most successful of which in point of detail was the Martyrs'    <BR>
Memorial in 1839. Between 1840 and 1860 it seemed established       <BR>
that the revival was to start from the last days of English Gothic. <BR>
This was surely a reasonable doctrine ; no one can wish architec-   <BR>
ture to remain imitative ; but a revived art must start from some   <BR>
point, and the last period of good work in past times is surely the <BR>
most natural point to start from. From that it may develope afresh  <BR>
in any direction. But chiefly owing to the writings of Mr. Ruskin,  <BR>
a new fashion set in. Everything was to be Gothic ; only it must    <BR>
not be any form of English Gothic. We were to go to Venice and      <BR>
Verona for details which suited Venice and Verona, but which did    <BR>
not suit England ; we were not to learn ay thing from Cow dray,     <BR>
Thornbury, or Wells. Lastly there has come a stranger fashion still <BR>
of all the styles in the world the one last picked out for imitation<BR>
has been the corrupt jumble of Gothic and Italian detail which      <BR>
prevailed in the time of James the First. This style, if style it   <BR>
can be called, marks a very interesting stage in the history of art;<BR>
hut surely, for a style to build in, any pure style of any kind     <BR>
would be better. It is like the macaronic verses, with one line     <BR>
in one language and the next in another. On the other hand, some    <BR>
colleges, like Magdalen and New College, have withstood all these   <BR>
strange fashions , and have steadily built in the latest form of    <BR>
